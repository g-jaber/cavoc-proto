# cavoc-proto


The prototype is currently formed by three binaries:
- ``explore`` takes a module and its signature, and provides
a way to play the environment role (aka Opponent) in the interaction, by choosing which input action to perform.
The goal is then to trigger a false assert in the code of the module.
- ``synch`` takes two modules with their signatures, and produces the trace of actions generated by the synchronization of their interaction.
- ``tree`` takes a module and produces the "game board" graph on which the interaction happened. (*TODO: to be renamed !*)

The language considered by the prototype is a fragment of OCaml with:
- higher-order functions
- recursive function-definitions and while loops
- Hindley-Milner polymorphic type system with value restriction
- type abstraction via signature (.ml/.mli organisation)
- integer, booleans, product and sum data-types
- dynamically generated mutable references
- assertions that trigger uncaughtable errors

The prototype is organized modularly:
- Our basic notion of bipartite LTS is defined by the signature INT_LTS in bilts.ml
- We provide a generic way to compute the product of two bipartite LTS via the functor Make of the file product_lts.ml
- The OGS LTS is defined in ogs.ml by a functor over Interactive.INT signature
- a functor Int_Make (CpsLang : Lang.Focusing.INTLANG) is provided in the file cps.ml 
to build a module of signature Interactive.INT.
- a functor Make (OpLang : Interactive.WITHNUP) is provided in the file lang/focusing.ml
- Our language RefML instantiates the signature Interactive.WITHNUP in the file
RefML/refml.ml
