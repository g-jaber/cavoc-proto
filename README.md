# cavoc-proto


The prototype is currently formed by three binaries that can be found in the bin/ directory:
- ``explore`` takes a module and its signature, and provides a way to play the environment role (aka Opponent) in the interaction, by choosing which input action to perform.
The goal is then to trigger a false assert in the code of the module.
- ``synch`` takes two modules with their signatures, and produces the trace of actions generated by the synchronization of their interaction.
- ``tree`` takes a module and produces the "game board" tree on which the interaction happened.

The prototype currently works on a fragment of OCaml with:
  * higher-order functions
  * recursive function-definitions and while loops
  * Hindley-Milner polymorphic type system with value restriction
  * type abstraction via signature (.ml/.mli organisation)
  * integer, booleans, product and sum data-types
  * dynamically generated mutable references
  * assertions that trigger uncatchable errors
  * exception and try-with

The lib/ directory contains the various subparts of the prototype:
- util/ contains some basic utility modules for printing, monads, partial maps and span. They should eventually be replaced by proper implementation found in existing libraries.
- lang/ contains the interfaces used to represent the programming languages:
  * language.ml contains the various signatures to represent the core of the programming language;
  * interactive.ml contains the signature used to represent the focusing process that decomposes normal forms.
  * cps.ml contains the interactive continuation-passing-style transformation of a language with nominal ultimate patterns (NUPs) into a language with abstract values.
- lts/ contains the interfaces used to represent the LTSs used to represent the interaction.
  * the signature INT_LTS in bipartite.ml is the  basic notion of bipartite LTS
  * We provide a generic way to compute the product of two bipartite LTS via the functor Make of the file product_lts.ml
  * a functor Int_Make (CpsLang : Lang.Cps.INTLANG) is provided in the file cps.ml to build a module of signature Interactive.INT. The main idea is to used continuation names, so that any moves has a subject name.
- ogs/ contains:
  * the definition of the OGS LTS in ogslts.ml, define by a functor over Interactive.INT signature 
  * including the well-bracketed part.
- RefML/ contains the definition of the main instance of a programming language:
  * refml.ml contains the instantiation of the signature Interactive.WITHNUP
  * interpreter.ml contains the monadic definitional interpreter.
